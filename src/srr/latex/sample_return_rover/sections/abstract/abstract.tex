Space exploration is still a topic of interest because technology is continuously developing. Exploring and researching Mars is the most convenient way to trial and test new space technologies since it is the closest planet to Earth that is able to conduct research on. NASA approached Mars exploration through the Sample-Return Rover, a robot that can explore unknown terrain autonomously and be able to collect samples. The earliest primitive model was launched in 1997, and the latest one being 2020 with the Curiosity Rover. This project focuses on recreating the earlier version of the rover in SolidWorks and being able to simulate the exploration in a 3D environment with Gazebo.\\
