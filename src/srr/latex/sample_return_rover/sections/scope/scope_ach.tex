For the scope of achievement and study, milestones and careful planning had to been made. Most of the concepts learned in this class were able to translate over to this project. 
A list of milestones are presented below, in order of planning and achievement. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Build the vehicle part of the rover
	\item Create the ROS workspace environment
	\item Create a terrain similar to Mars terrain in Gazebo
	\item Test the vehicle URDF and tune the controls
	\item Build the arm for the rover
	\item Calculate and create scripts for the kinematics of the arm
\end{enumerate}
