The \ac{TCA} analyzed in this report was implemented in response to alarming amounts of damage discovered to the wheels of the \ac{CMR} while already in operation on the Martian surface. Once the cause was isolated to be the wheels climbing sharp rocks and then speeding up quickly to maintain its Ackermann Steering Model of control, it was determined that changes in its software must be made to accommodate for this error in assumption. The analysis done here took the concepts for the original implementation, broke them down into digestible concepts that built on one another, and presented the foundation of a simulation of the system implemented on an earlier iteration of the \ac{CMR} known as the \ac{SRR}. The original report provided data as to how their changes improved their system, and the simulations here seemed to agree with the theory behind the original implementation.
