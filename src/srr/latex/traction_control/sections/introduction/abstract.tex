Throughout recent decades, the topic of space exploration is desirable towards scientists and researchers. Mars is the nearest planet that is possible to explore in great detail. There are many challenges pertaining to exploring unknown territory, through long distance, and difficulty of remotely operating robots. NASAâ€™s approach to exploring and researching Mars was through the Sample Return Rover, created in 1997 by the JPL Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The scope of this project focuses on the Mars Rover, its wheel-slip detection (traction control), and path-planning towards a desired object.
